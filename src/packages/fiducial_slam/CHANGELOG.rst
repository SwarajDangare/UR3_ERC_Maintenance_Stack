0.12.0 (2021-07-30)
-------------------
* Merge pull request `#259 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/259>`_ from ivan140/feature/pose_publish_rate
  Added pose_publish_rate which controls the rate of /fiducial_pose
* added feature pose_publish_rate which controls the rate of topic /fiducial_pose
* Merge pull request `#258 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/258>`_ from UbiquityRobotics/opencv-deprecated-constant
  Replace deprecated OpenCV constant in fiducial_slam test
* Replace deprecated OpenCV constant in fiducial_slam test
* Merge pull request `#244 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/244>`_ from agutenkunst/fix/remove_unused_subs
  I think this is sensible to merge, since it does not affect the workings of the package and it removes some confusion, so merging
* Remove non-functional doPoseEstimation from fiducial_slam
* Remove unused subscriber
* Merge pull request `#221 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/221>`_ from `UbiquityRobotics/bugfix-#220 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/bugfix-/issues/220>`_
  Allow covariance to be overridden by launch file
* Allow covariance to be overriden by launch file
  Uses YAML interpretation for the parameter so that it becomes an array
  instead of a string. Fix a comparison issue in the code to make the
  override actually warn on 0 values.
* Return early from auto init when no fiducials
* Merge pull request `#214 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/214>`_ from UbiquityRobotics/publish_fids

  Cleanup for fiducial_slam
* add and run clang-format
* Get rid of observation.positon, it was only being used in 1 place
* Links to other fiducials uses set instead map<int,int>
  We only care if the element exists or not, so a set is a
  clearer data structure to use.
* Unused sum_in_qudrature removed, holdover from Alexy stuff
* Use clearer ranged for where possible
  Ranged for provides an easier way to interate over every
  element in a containter.
  NOTE: This commit changes what I consider to be buggy behavior
  in the autoInit and findClosestObs code, which was not properly
  iterating over every elemnent, using obs[0] every time.
* Remove using namespace declarations
  These are generally considered dangerous, due to the potential
  for namespace collisions and unclarity when using types.

0.11.0 (2019-05-09)
-------------------
* Compatibilty with Melodic, remove opencv3 dependancy
  opencv3 is no longer a package in melodic, so we use cv_bridge
  to get the correct opencv transitively
* New fusion with planar-based error estimation
  * Estimate variance of fiducial obsevations based on how well they place the robot on the floor upright
  * use Kalman + David method of fusing estimates
  * split out Transform with Variance, do some cleanup
  * Simple unit tests for core fusion code
  * remove hokey outlier rejection
* Add support for overriding covariance diagonal
* Add fiducial transform array stamp (`#156 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/156>`_)
* Add publish_tf rosparam functionality and updated launch file accordingly (`#154 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/154>`_)
  * Added publish_tf rosparam to disable publishing pose tf
  * Change default publish_tf to True and fix 'if' formatting
* Contributors: Jack Kilian, Jim Vaughan, Rohan Agrawal

0.10.0 (2018-10-13)
-------------------
* use sum in quadrature by default
* Disable multifiducial estimate by default
* Added a tool for fitting a plane

* Contributors: Jim Vaughan, Rohan Agrawal

0.9.0 (2018-09-12)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#112 <https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials/issues/112>`_ from UbiquityRobotics/davecrawley-patch-1
  Added in a systematic error parameter
* fix missed rename alexy to sum in quadrature
* Suggested changes
* Updating the launch file to match the changes to map.cpp
* Added in a systematic error parameter
  Added in a systematic error parameter. This parameter is intended to take in to account systematic (non-random) errors in the measurement of fiducial position. Non-random errors can be very pernicious, and can generate highly unexpected and difficult to resolve issues. For example if **all** the fiducials are slightly the wrong size this will not show up as a random variance. Similar systematic errors include, camera mis-calibration, sampling defects, digitization errors, lens flaring and so forth. Measurement accuracy in-homogeneity can also be considered a systematic error and this will also help with that issue although it probably should be treated explicitly rather than through this "hack". Ultimately the correct approach is to rigorously compute all these systematic errors and add them in to the model - we are simply saying that we think the systematic errors are less than the specified value.
